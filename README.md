== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why when i pick any content items it add unknown image as  the card image? =
It happens if you you page, post or other content types has no Featured Image. If plugin doesn't find it adds default image, you can replace it with any other. Featured image is should be added in the past add/edit page(usually on right sidebar box)
= My page has Featured Image, but instead it plugin uses one from previous card? =
You try to add it too fast. To pick image plugin does additional request, as featured image doesn't included to post object, only its id. You should just wait 1-2 seconds before to click add. In the next versions we are also going to add options to collect image frob article body if it exists.
= How many cards I can add? =
As many as you wish. In horizontal mode maximum cards in row is four, but  you can have more. If you amount not equal 4 for row, rest of cards also have same width and will be centered.

= What icons do you use =
We use FontAwesome version 5. We tried to use Google Material Icons as it has 4 more parameters for settings, but unfortunately it's done as direct code, not as class - ie it can show code, for a moments while css is loading, it's not good, especially if icon is big as we use.
= What is export option =
Using export option you can copy JSON code of cards and pass it to another or even to another site. Import is looks like export - just click export tab on new cards, and paste code replacing existing default one. Don't forget to save and reload page then
= I have problem with my cards, how can you help me =
Function Export also was done for debugging, just copy code from Export tab and send.
